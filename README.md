# IshiharaPlate
 Randomly generates Ishihara plates.
 
 Ishihara plates are the circular things with dots that contain a number or letter. They are used to test for color blindness.
 As someone who is actually colorblind (err color impaired) I wanted to see *how* colorblind I was. 
 
 Anyway, to use this you simply just run `MainFX.java` and it will randomly generate an Ishihara plate. If you like the way the Ishihara plate looks, press `Ctrl+S` and it'll save a json representation of the Ishihara plate.
 I will admit that changing the colors is kinda buried, but I'm not posting this as an actual library, but rather as an example of how you can generate Ishihara plates.
 
 Hopefully someone finds this useful.
